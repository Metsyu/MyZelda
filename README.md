# MyZelda
A Zelda inspired game, originally developed in Java, then ported to JavaScript, then to Python.

Each iteration has been uploaded onto its own branch.

The game controls are as follows: Arrow keys to move, 'CTRL' to throw daggers.

In the Java version, an edit mode is also included, to toggle on edit mode use the 'E' key.
Once in edit mode, click on the window to add new bricks, use the 'P' key to toggle whether or not pots will be placed, then click on the window to add pots.
While in edit mode, you can also move between the rooms with the 'W' key to move up, 'A' to move left, 'X to move down, and 'D' to move right. Once you create a new
map, the 'S' key can be used to save your new map, and the 'L' key can be used to reload the map.
The 'ESC' and 'Q' keys can both be used to exit the game.

In the JavaScript and Python version, functionality is reduced, since there is no longer an edit mode. Game controls are the same.
